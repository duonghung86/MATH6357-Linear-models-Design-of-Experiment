2.22. The time to repair an electronic instrument is a normally distributed random variable measured in hours. The repair
times for 16 such instruments chosen at random are as follows:
Hours
159 280 101 212
224 379 179 264
222 362 168 250
149 260 485 170
(a) You wish to know if the mean repair time exceeds 225
hours. Set up appropriate hypotheses for investigating
this issue.
(b) Test the hypotheses you formulated in part (a). What
are your conclusions? Use alpha= 0.05.
(c) Find the P-value for the test.
(d) Construct a 95 percent confidence interval on mean
repair time.
