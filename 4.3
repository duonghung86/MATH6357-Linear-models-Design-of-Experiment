A chemist wishes to test the effect of four chemical
agents on the strength of a particular type of cloth. Because
there might be variability from one bolt to another, the
chemist decides to use a randomized block design, with the
bolts of cloth considered as blocks. She selects five bolts and
applies all four chemicals in random order to each bolt. The
resulting tensile strengths follow. Analyze the data from this
experiment (use alpha= 0.05) and draw appropriate conclusions
